# Conversion Psychology - Metodo Cria Quiz

**Companion to:** `lovable-cria-strategy.md`
**Purpose:** Deep psychological framework for quiz design and copy decisions

## 1. The Psychology of Quiz Conversion

### Why Quizzes Convert

Quizzes exploit three cognitive biases simultaneously:

1. **Self-serving bias** -- People want to learn about themselves and will trade personal data for self-knowledge
2. **Commitment escalation** -- Each answered question increases investment, making abandonment psychologically costly
3. **Curiosity gap** -- Once promised a "result," the brain cannot rest until it closes the loop

### The Metodo Cria Specific Hook

The target audience is stuck in a **knowledge-action gap**. They know about digital business. They have consumed hours of content. What they lack is not information -- it is **identity**.

The quiz bridges this gap by saying: "You already are a type of digital creator. Let us name it."

This reframe is powerful because it shifts from "you need to become something" to "you already are something -- let us reveal it." This removes the biggest barrier: the belief that they are not ready.

## 2. Emotional Journey Map (Per Screen)

### Screen 1: Landing / Cover

**Emotion to trigger:** Curiosity + Recognition
**Psychology:** The visitor must feel "this is about ME" within 2 seconds

Key principles:
- Use second person ("Voce") immediately
- Reference their internal state, not external facts
- Avoid mentioning products, courses, or money
- The question format ("Qual tipo de...") activates identity-seeking behavior

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- "Descubra como ganhar dinheiro online" (triggers sales resistance)
- "Teste seus conhecimentos" (triggers performance anxiety)
- Stock photos of laptops on beaches (triggers distrust)

### Screens 2-8: Questions

**Emotion to trigger:** Engagement + Self-reflection
**Psychology:** Each question should feel like a mirror, not a test

Design principles:
- No wrong answers -- every option must feel equally valid and appealing
- Use concrete scenarios over abstract concepts ("Imagine you have a free Saturday" vs "Rate your introversion")
- Progress indicator creates completion momentum (sunk cost)
- Alternate between light/fun and deeper/meaningful questions to maintain energy
- Question 7 (final) should be the most emotionally resonant -- this is the "peak" moment

**Pacing model:**
```
Q1: Light, fun (warm-up)
Q2: Slightly deeper
Q3: Scenario-based (engagement peak 1)
Q4: Values-based (most revealing)
Q5: Practical preference
Q6: Behavioral (what they actually do)
Q7: Identity statement (emotional peak)
```

### Screen 9: Result Reveal

**Emotion to trigger:** Validation + Excitement + Belonging
**Psychology:** This is the MOST critical screen. The result must feel earned and specific.

Principles:
- Lead with the archetype NAME in large type (identity anchoring)
- First paragraph must be pure validation: "You are someone who..."
- Include a strength they secretly believe about themselves but rarely hear confirmed
- The "famous example" creates aspiration and belonging ("You share traits with...")
- End with ONE specific action -- not three, not five, ONE

**The Barnum Effect (weaponized ethically):**
Each archetype description should be 70% universal (feels accurate to anyone) and 30% specific (feels personalized). The specific 30% comes from their actual answer patterns.

### Screen 10: Lead Capture

**Emotion to trigger:** Desire for more + Fear of losing the moment
**Psychology:** They just received something valuable. Now create incompleteness.

Principles:
- Frame as "receiving your complete profile" not "signing up"
- The result page shows 60% of the archetype detail -- WhatsApp unlocks the rest
- Use loss aversion: "Your profile was generated now. We do not store it -- save it via WhatsApp."
- WhatsApp feels more personal and less corporate than email in Brazil
- Email is secondary capture ("also send to email for reference")

## 3. Objection Psychology

### Pre-Quiz Objections (Landing Page)

| Objection | Cognitive Root | Counter-Strategy |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Another marketing quiz" | Pattern recognition / cynicism | Zero mention of products. Pure self-discovery framing. |
| "Results will be BS" | Past disappointment | Social proof: "Based on research with 500+ digital creators" |
| "I do not have time" | Attention scarcity | "2 minutos. 7 perguntas." -- Extreme specificity signals respect for time |
| "Why should I care?" | Low perceived value | Headline must create identity curiosity, not promise benefits |

### Mid-Quiz Objections (Drop-off Risks)

| Trigger | Screen | Counter-Strategy |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| "These questions feel random" | Q2-Q3 | Add micro-copy: "Cada resposta revela uma camada do seu perfil" |
| "I cannot choose, both apply" | Any | Allow "both" or "it depends" as valid options (maps to balanced archetype) |
| "This is taking too long" | Q4-Q5 | Progress bar + "Quase la!" at 60% mark |

### Post-Result Objections (Lead Capture)

| Objection | Counter-Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "I got my result, why give info?" | Incomplete reveal: "Your full profile includes your blind spots and ideal first project" |
| "I do not want spam" | "One message with your profile. You decide if you want more." |
| "WhatsApp feels invasive" | Email-first option with WhatsApp as "bonus: get your profile as audio summary" |

## 4. Persuasion Frameworks Applied

### Cialdini's Principles in the Quiz Flow

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Free, valuable archetype result creates obligation to reciprocate (give contact) |
| **Commitment** | Each question deepens investment; abandoning feels like waste |
| **Social Proof** | "Join 2,000+ people who discovered their creator archetype" |
| **Authority** | "Metodo Cria" implies a validated methodology |
| **Liking** | Casual PT-BR tone, relatable scenarios, no corporate voice |
| **Scarcity** | "Your profile was generated in real-time. Save it now." |

### Fogg Behavior Model (B = MAP)

For the target behavior (complete quiz + share contact):

- **Motivation:** High (they want self-knowledge and direction)
- **Ability:** Must be high (mobile-optimized, tap-only interaction, no typing until lead capture)
- **Prompt:** The result reveal IS the prompt -- "Want the complete version?"

## 5. Cultural Considerations (Brazil)

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|------------|
| WhatsApp dominance | WhatsApp > Email for lead quality and response rate |
| "Jeitinho brasileiro" | Tone must be warm, not corporate. Humor is welcome. |
| Distrust of "gurus" | Avoid guru positioning. Frame as tool/methodology, not person. |
| Mobile-first reality | 90%+ on mobile. Every interaction must work with thumbs. |
| Visual culture (Instagram) | Result must be screenshot-worthy / shareable |
| "Voce" vs "Tu" | Use "voce" (universal BR Portuguese, not regional) |
| Income sensitivity | Never ask income directly. Infer from lifestyle questions. |

---

## 6. Shareability Engineering

The result page must be designed for Instagram Stories sharing:

- Archetype name + icon in a visually distinct card format
- Aspect ratio friendly to Stories (9:16 crop area)
- Include a subtle "Descubra o seu: [link]" at the bottom of shareable card
- Each archetype gets a distinct color palette for visual differentiation
- The share action is ORGANIC viral growth -- design for it explicitly
