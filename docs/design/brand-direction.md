## 1. Visual Identity: The Vibe

### One-word: IGNITION

This quiz is the spark. The moment before the fire catches. The design should feel like standing at the edge of something -- focused, electric, warm.

### Vibe Spectrum

```
NOT this                              THIS                              NOT this
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Corporate   Sterile   Clean   Warm   ELECTRIC   Edgy   Chaotic   Noisy
                                        ^
                                   WE ARE HERE
```

**Electric-warm.** Dark backgrounds create focus. Amber accents create energy. Clean typography creates trust. The combination says: "This is serious, but it is also alive."

### What Makes It GRIT

GRIT in this context means: you cannot scroll past it. The design achieves this through:

1. **Contrast tension** -- Dark background with hot amber creates visual tension that holds attention
2. **Single-column focus** -- No sidebars, no navigation, no escape routes. You and the quiz, nothing else
3. **Progressive revelation** -- Each screen reveals only what matters NOW. No cognitive overload
4. **Earned result** -- The loading screen creates anticipation. The result feels deserved, not given
5. **Screenshot-worthy identity** -- The archetype card is designed to be shared. It BECOMES your identity on social

## 2. Emotional Tone Through Design

### Colors That Evoke Ambition

| Color | Emotion | Where Used |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Dark (#0F0F0F) | Focus, premium, immersion | Background -- removes distractions |
| Amber (#F59E0B) | Ambition, energy, warmth | CTAs, progress, highlights -- guides action |
| Warm Orange (#F97316) | Expression, courage | Comunicador archetype |
| Deep Teal (#14B8A6) | Wisdom, guidance | Mentor archetype |
| Strong Blue (#3B82F6) | Reliability, building | Construtor archetype |
| Rich Purple (#8B5CF6) | Vision, uniqueness | Estrategista archetype |

### Typography That Commands

- **Headlines (Inter ExtraBold 800):** Heavy weight commands attention. No decorative fonts. No playfulness. Straight, bold, clear
- **Body (Inter Regular 400):** Clean and warm. High line-height (1.6) creates breathing room -- never feels dense
- **Option text (Inter Medium 500):** Slightly bolder than body to feel like real choices, not fine print
- **Micro-copy (12px):** Present but never competing. Knows its place

### Layouts That Create Focus

- **Single column:** The eye has ONE path. Down. That is it
- **Generous whitespace:** 24-48px between sections. The content breathes. Nothing feels crammed
- **Full-bleed color bands:** The archetype result breaks the contained column with full-width color. This is the reward moment
- **No navigation:** Once you start, forward is the only direction. This creates momentum

## 3. Differentiation: Why THIS Quiz Feels Different

### What Most Quizzes Look Like

- White background, blue buttons
- Generic illustrations or stock photos
- Cluttered with logos, menus, footers
- Results feel like a paragraph nobody reads
- Desktop-first, mobile is an afterthought

### What THIS Quiz Feels Like

- **Dark and focused** -- feels like a private conversation, not a marketing page
- **Zero clutter** -- nothing on screen except the question and your options
- **Options feel like cards you are dealing** -- tactile, weighted, not checkboxes
- **The result is an IDENTITY** -- bold archetype name, color-coded, shareable
- **Mobile-native** -- designed for thumbs, not mice
- **Brazilian voice** -- casual PT-BR, not translated English marketing speak

### The "Screenshot Test"

Every screen should pass this test: if someone screenshots this and posts it, does it look good? Does it communicate something?

- Entry screen: "Hmm, what is this quiz?" (curiosity)
- Question screen: "This is a well-made quiz" (quality signal)
- Result screen: "I am O Comunicador!" (identity + shareability)

## 4. Brand Patterns

### Visual Signature Elements

1. **The amber glow** -- Buttons have a soft amber shadow that makes them feel warm and alive
2. **The dark canvas** -- Consistent dark background creates a premium, focused feel
3. **The progress bar** -- Thin, amber, always visible. Creates completion momentum
4. **The color reveal** -- Throughout the quiz, everything is amber-on-dark. The RESULT page explodes with the archetype's unique color. This contrast makes the reveal feel special
5. **The archetype card** -- A self-contained visual unit designed for social sharing

### What We NEVER Do

- Use stock photography
- Add decorative illustrations
- Use more than one accent color per screen (except the result page)
- Add animations that delay user action
- Use gradients on text
- Place text on busy backgrounds
- Use light mode (the dark theme IS the brand)

## 5. Shareability Design

### Instagram Stories Optimization

The result screen includes a shareable card designed for 9:16 format:

```
+---------------------------+
|                           |
|   [Archetype color bg]   |
|                           |
|      [Icon - 48px]        |
|                           |
|      Voce e:              |
|    O COMUNICADOR          |
|    [32px, white, bold]    |
|                           |
|   "Voce transforma        |
|    conhecimento em        |
|    conexao"               |
|    [16px, white, italic]  |
|                           |

+---------------------------+
```

- Each archetype's card uses its unique color as background
- The link at the bottom enables organic viral growth
- The card dimensions work for Stories, feed posts, and WhatsApp forwards
- No heavy branding -- the archetype IS the brand moment

## 6. Voice + Design Alignment

| Copy Tone | Design Equivalent |
|-----------|------------------|
| Casual ("voce", short sentences) | Clean layouts, generous spacing, no visual jargon |
| Direct ("Sem enrolacao") | Single column, one action per screen, no distractions |
| Warm ("A gente entende") | Amber accents, dark-but-not-black backgrounds, rounded corners |
| Confident ("Seu perfil esta pronto") | Bold typography, strong color, no question marks in CTAs |
| Intimate (Q7 first-person quotes) | Slightly larger padding, italic text, no letter labels |
